# Hello, I'm Rosa.

I am an Information Technology student with a strong interest in cybersecurity, actively developing system administration and security fundamentals through hands-on labs, platforms such as TryHackMe, and independent study. I am driven by a desire to understand how systems operate at a deep level and how to secure them against real-world threats. I am building a solid technical foundation to support and defend modern IT environments.

## Objective
To build a strong IT and system administration foundation and transition into a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst role focused on threat detection, analysis, and incident response.
